## ‚ö° What the Script Does

The installation script automatically performs these steps:

1. **Installs build dependencies** (compiler, libraries, tools)
2. **Downloads and compiles Python 3.12.3** in `~/.local/python3.12.3/`
3. **Sets up pipx environment** for package management
4. **Installs comfy-cli** - the official ComfyUI manager
5. **Downloads ComfyUI** in `~/comfy/ComfyUI/`
6. **Creates systemd service** for automatic startup
7. **Cleans up temporary files**

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why compile Python instead of using system Python?

### Q: How to change the port?
**A:** Edit the service file and change the port in ExecStart:
```bash
sudo systemctl edit comfyui
# Change to: ExecStart=/home/username/.local/bin/comfy launch --port 8080
```

### Q: Where are models stored?
