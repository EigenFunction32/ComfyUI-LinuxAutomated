3. **üêç Downloads & compiles Python 3.12.3** in `~/.local/python3.12.3/`
4. **üõ†Ô∏è Sets up pipx environment** for isolated package management
5. **üé® Installs comfy-cli** - the official ComfyUI manager
6. **üöÄ Downloads ComfyUI** in `~/comfy/ComfyUI/`
7. **‚öôÔ∏è Creates systemd service** for automatic startup (if available)
8. **üßπ Cleans up temporary files**

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why compile Python instead of using system Python?
**A:** Isolated Python ensures compatibility, avoids conflicts with system packages, and provides a consistent environment across different distributions.

### Q: Can I change the port?
**A:** Yes! Edit the service file:
```bash
sudo systemctl edit comfyui
# Change ExecStart to: ExecStart=/home/username/.local/bin/comfy launch --port 8080
sudo systemctl restart comfyui
```

### Q: Where are models stored?
**A:** Models are in `~/comfy/ComfyUI/models/`. Use ComfyUI Manager (web interface) to download models easily.

### Q: How to run multiple instances?
**A:** Create separate service files with different ports and working directories.

### Q: Is internet required during installation?
**A:** Yes, for downloading Python source, dependencies, and ComfyUI components.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes
